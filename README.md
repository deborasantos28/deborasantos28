## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<h3>My name is Debora Santos ðŸ˜„ and I've recently graduated as Junior Web Software developer. </h3> 
<h4>I'm incredibly curious about what makes certain things work, which is one of the reasons as to why I got involved into Web Development. 
Anything unusual and "out of the box" ðŸ‘½ is amongst my favourite things to work with. Also I get incredibly passionate about working with themes that hold meaning to me </h4>

<h5> 
ðŸ’­ Currently working through some ideas for my next project, based on a virtual reality social platform called Second Life.
</h5>

<h5>
ðŸŒ± I am currently trying to extend my knowledge of JavaScript, so I can become more proficient in this language.
</h5>

<h5>
ðŸ’¬ I am extremely friendly person, so don't hesitate in contact me about ideas or collaborations. 
</h5>

<h5>
âš¡ Fun Fact: I am an extremely avid gamer! I love all things gaming ðŸ˜Ž
One of the reasons why I wanted to learn to code was due to my love for gaming. 
Web Development and Game programming are two completely different sides, but the sky is the limit, and we should always keep learning and improving ourselves.
And that's what I plan to do ðŸ˜„
